# Projekt-MPC-ABO

Topic of this project is *Detection of centre of the left ventricle of hearth in MRI data*.

**Goals of the project**

-Design and implement automatic algorithm for detection of centre of the left ventricle
of hearth in 2D slice of MRI data
-Validate the proposed algorithm on the given
publicly available dataset and statistically evaluate the accuracy of the detection
using available ground truth masks
